//! # PROVENANCE, 2026-09-24 — this file was `busbar-plugin-testkit`
//!
//! The owner ruled the shared testkit crate DELETED on 2026-09-22 (*"delete it. wtf is a
//! testkit."*; busbar commit 2846dcff5), which DECISIONS #33 already asserted (*"There is NO
//! `testkit` — dead, not a crate and not a feature: each plugin self-tests (#2); the kernel tests no
//! plugin"*). #2/#31 are the reason the suite could not simply move to one crate and be shared from
//! there: a plugin is a 3rd party living in its own repo, and cross-plugin shared test utils are
//! exactly what that topology forbids. busbar re-homed its in-tree backends' copies the same way.
//!
//! So the suite is COPIED, not relocated, and this backend owns its copy outright. The duplication is
//! the ruled design, not an accident of the move — the cost #2 accepts in exchange for a plugin that
//! can be built and tested with no sibling in the tree.
//!
//! WHICH VERSION: everything below this header is BYTE-IDENTICAL to
//! `crates/plugin-testkit/src/store_conformance.rs` at busbar `eac13fa3f` — the `.busbar-ref` pin
//! this repo builds against, i.e. the exact code this backend's conformance tests were running. The
//! testkit's LAST version (2846dcff5^) is written against the 1.6.0 `Store` trait (neutral
//! `PlaneRecord` verbs, new `VirtualKey` fields) that this backend does not implement yet, so it
//! cannot compile here. The four checks this backend wires are unchanged between the two versions;
//! the later additions (`assert_put_credential_requires_a_live_key`,
//! `assert_put_key_with_credential_is_atomic`, and the eight-verb plane-record battery) were never
//! wired here and have to be copied in by hand with the 1.6.0 port.
//!
//! The "reaches every backend on its next dependency bump" promise in the doc below is therefore
//! NO LONGER TRUE of this copy, and is left standing as the record of what the shared crate was for.
//! Contract conformance for [`busbar_api::Store`] — the checks every backend must pass identically.
//!
//! These exist because an audit found the fleet disagreeing with itself: the same input produced a
//! different outcome depending on which store an operator had deployed. `revoke_credential` on an
//! unknown id errored on three backends and silently succeeded on two. `delete_key` on an unknown id
//! split the other way. `append_audit` on a duplicate `seq` had three distinct behaviours across four
//! backends. None of that was a defect in any one backend — the trait doc had not settled it, so each
//! implementation settled it alone.
//!
//! The trait doc settles it now, and this module is how that ruling stays settled. A backend calls
//! these from its own test module; a new ruling added here reaches every backend on its next
//! dependency bump, instead of being hand-copied into each repo and drifting again.
//!
//! # Namespacing, and why every helper takes one
//!
//! Two of the backends (store-postgres, store-mysql) run their suites against a SHARED, live
//! database that is not reset between tests, and their CI can run more than one test binary against
//! it at once. A fixture on a fixed id would then make two concurrent runs each other's failure —
//! store-postgres's own audit test already derives its `seq` from the process id for exactly this
//! reason. So every helper takes an `ns` (or an explicit `seq`) and derives its fixtures from it.
//!
//! The caller owns cleanup: **reset [`key_ids`] and [`credential_ids`] for your `ns`, and delete
//! your `seq`, before calling.** An in-memory backend gets this for free by opening a fresh store;
//! a shared-database backend must issue the deletes itself, since this crate has no SQL of its own.
//!
//! Usage, from a store plugin's own tests:
//! ```ignore
//! use busbar_plugin_testkit::store_conformance as conf;
//!
//! #[test]
//! fn put_key_does_not_resurrect_a_tombstone() {
//!     let ns = format!("conf{}", std::process::id());
//!     hard_reset(&store, &conf::key_ids(&ns));   // the backend's own cleanup
//!     conf::assert_put_key_does_not_resurrect_a_tombstone(&open(), &ns);
//! }
//! ```
